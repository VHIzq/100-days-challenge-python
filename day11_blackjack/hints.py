############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
import random

def deal_card():
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  card = random.choice(cards)
  return card
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().


def compare(user_score, computer_score):
  if user_score == computer_score:
    

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(hand_cards):
  #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
  
  #Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
  
  is_blackjack = sum(hand_cards) == 21 and len(hand_cards) == 2
  if is_blackjack:
    return 0
  
  is_burst = sum(hand_cards) > 21
  if 11 in hand_cards and is_burst:
    hand_cards.remove(11)
    hand_cards.append(1)
  
  return  sum(hand_cards)

user_cards = []
computer_cards = []
is_game_over = False

for _ in range(2):
  user_cards.append(deal_card())
  computer_cards.append(deal_card())

while not is_game_over:

  computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
  user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)

  print(f'Your cards are {user_cards} with score: {user_score}')
  print(f'Computer first card: {computer_cards[0]}')

  if user_score == 0 or computer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
    is_game_over = True
  else:
    ask_card = input('Type "y" if you want another card, type "n" if you dont.')
    if ask_card == 'y':
      user_cards.append(deal_card())
    else:
      is_game_over = True
  
while computer_score < 17 and computer_score != 0:
  computer_cards.append(deal_card())
  computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)



#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
